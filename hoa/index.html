      <h3>Noscope/Ryan</h3>
      <div class="scrollable">
        <p>Noscope/Ryan is this guy who tries to act like an internet thug CORN BALL!. He claims to be dangerous and he is a corny packer, but all he does when packing is talk really fast and ends up sounding like a retard. He also brags about having multiple girls at once, One day, this random guy approached my girl, Sinful, and asked if she knew Noscope. He told her that Noscope is actually a catfish and used to be part of a gang called the Monkey Group. Apparently, Noscope got bullied out of the group.</p>
